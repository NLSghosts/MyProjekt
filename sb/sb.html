   <a>Your Mission is to farm gems that you are becoming form Tress,Farms,Mobs and from the 
    Middle. Every game you do has a Timelimit when hit 0 is the game finsished. You need to farm coins
    that you can gain in the same way you get the games except the Middle to open 
    chests for Trupps, more trupps you have in your Team the more have you to pay. For 3 Trupps of the same
    you gain a evolve on in your team who is 3x times stronger than normal. every player has a Turbo, that you can become
    in maps modifier and blue boxes, with these you can run faster
    but not to long if you can Turbo you need wait until the Turbo is ready again.</a>

    <h2>Decos for your placa</h2>
    <a>You can use these Hammers to buy some decos for your placa with common, super rare and epic raritys
    by a trader on your placa, every rarity has different prices do buy your decos. And the epic
    one have a nice design but you need to pay very much Hammers for these decos. Chose carefully what decos you buy, because you dont get that much of these
    Hammers,you can gain these Hammers in the worldtravel away and from the Squad Buster Pass and from the
    finsished matches you play or from the Shops in the game.
